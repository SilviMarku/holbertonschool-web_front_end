## Selectors, Properties, and Values

**Selectors:** CSS selectors define which HTML elements the CSS rules should apply to. They can target elements by type, class, ID, and more. Common selectors include `p` (element type), `.my-class` (class), and `#my-id` (ID).

**Properties:** CSS properties determine what aspect of the selected elements you want to style. Common properties include `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, and `padding`.

**Values:** Values are assigned to properties and specify the specific style you want to apply. For example, `color: red` sets the text color to red.

Example:
```css
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

## Block vs. Inline Styling

**Block-level elements:** These create block formatting contexts, typically stacking vertically and taking up the full width of their containing element. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>`.

**Inline-level elements:** These flow within the content, only taking up as much width as necessary. They don't create line breaks before and after themselves. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<em>`.

## Ensuring Consistency Across Browsers (CSS Reset)

To ensure consistent rendering across different browsers, developers often use CSS resets or normalizations. These stylesheets clear browser-specific default styles, providing a clean slate for developers to style elements. Popular CSS reset libraries include Normalize.css and Reset.css.

Example (using Normalize.css):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/8.0.1/normalize.min.css">
```
